Hello, 

The io of lu is optimal at ( 2 / 3 ) * n^3  / sqrt( S ). See attached code. 

Can we please change table 1 to indicate this? 

Right now the ratio is at 3/2, it should be at 1 with a checkmark.

Can we please change table 1 to indicate this? 

I also would love these codes to be in supplementary material. (See PDF.)

This is the same work as for Cholesky. This is a schedule that performs the optimal  ( 2 / 3 ) * n^3  / sqrt( S ). See attached code. 

The attached code has a parameter nb (the block size) and then its parameters are:

max_cache_useage_ = nb * nb + 2 * nb;

number_io_ = ( ( 2 * n * n * n / nb + 9 * n * n - 5 * nb * n ) / 3 )

IO counts READ and WRITE combined. (WRITE being O(n^2) so negligible.)

Typically one would take nb = floor( sqrt(S+1) - 1 ), so that nb^2 +nb < S 

So asymptotically, take nb = sqrt( S ), then 

max_cache_useage_ < S 

number_io_ = ( 2 / 3 ) * n^3  / sqrt( S )

( Same as the lower bound returned from IOLB. )

Cheers, 
Julien.
